How to utilize the visualizer:

Run on the command line: pip install Pillow numpy

Have the visualizer.py and the images inside the same folder 
(for example: your project folder could have  pipe.py, search.py, test pipe 1-9, ..., visualizer.py, images)

Run the command : python3 visualizer.py '<path to grid file>' ( for example,  python3 .\visualizer.py 'test pipe 1-9\test-01.out')

You should see a Grid_Image.png on your project folder!
